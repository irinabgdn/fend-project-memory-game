## Instructions
Use your mouse to flip cards. You have to match all the cards to win the game. 

The timer starts when the first card is flipped and stops when all the cards are matched. 

The rating depends on the number of moves made in order to win the game. Less moves give a higher rating.

## Resources
The timer method is built upon a solution for accurate JavaScript timers from [www.sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/creating-accurate-timers-in-javascript/).
